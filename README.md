# Bad Bank

Bad Bank is application that allows you to add and remove users from a bank database. It reference as bad because the security/authentication is not in place just yet

## Description/Motivation: 

To create a web application that allows an admin to add or withdraw "funds" and to add users to the database.

## Installation Guidelines:

This application uses mongodb, node express, and we recommend using Docker for your container and robo3T for a visual representation of your database.

Before running the application make sure you install any node packages and also make sure you install express:

```
npm install

npm install express
```

To run the application:
```bash
node index.js
```
You should recieve a :
```
Running on port: 3000
Connected successfully to db server
```
## Technology used:
MongoDB
Javascript
Robo3T
HTML
CSS/Bootstrap
Docker

## Features: 
Features including creating and anding user, viewing all available users, show bank balances. Would like to add better security features which will use Firebase for authentication.
